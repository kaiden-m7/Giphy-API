# Giphy-API

This application will be used to load gifs onto te webpage. When a user loads to page there will be an array of buttons i have used already as music artists. when the user clicks the buttons 10 gifs will load to the page. The user can add their own button for new music I do not have listed. 

The gifs will appear on the screen as 'still' and when the user clicks the image the gif will 'animate' then go 'still' if clicked again. The user also has the option of removing the last button and gifs they added to the array. 

The gifs come from Giphy API and I have a peronal key linked to the URL, using '.ajax' I am able to call the gifs to the page from the JSON link from the API.
